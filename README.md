# Creating a Predictive Model for Employees Turnover using Logistic Regression and Machine Learning
This is the final project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certification. The aim of this project is to plan, analyze, construct and execute a predictive model that helps a company understand why their employees may leave and prevent it.

# Introducing the Business Case
Salifort Motors' senior leadership team is concerned because of how many employees are leaving the company (for the time being they won't make a difference between employees who resigned and the ones who were let go). This affects the work culture of the company, morale of employees and ends on high administrative and financial costs (since replacing people involves recruiting, training and upskilling).

They asked their human resources department to conduct a massive survey among employees and deliver the data.

# Goals of the project
  1) Construct a Predictive Model that helps determine if an employee is likely to leave or not. This will help increase employee retention.
  2) Understand the main factors that lead to employees leaving the organization.
  3) Get some recommendations on actionable next steps to decrease the employee turnover rate.

# Initial Data Model
